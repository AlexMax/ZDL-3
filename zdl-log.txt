*-- Stuff left to do --*
	* DMFlag Calculator
	* ZDLNet branch

*-- Known Bugs --*
	* None that I know of but I'm sure there are a few.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

!-- Version 3.0d --!
	*-- Dec 10th 2005 --*
		* Fixed : Entering a port of IWAD path without a '\\' would
			crash ZDL.
		* Fixed : The current directory should be set to the selected
			port's dir so the proper files are loaded.

!-- Version 3.0c --!
	*-- Dec 2nd 2005 --*
		* Fixed : ReadINI() Didn't close the file and free memory if it
			failed for some reason.
		* Fixed : If you tried to load a config file with no ports or
			IWADs ZDL would crash.

!-- Version 3.0b --!
	*-- Dec 2nd 2005 --*
		* Fixed : ZDL is supposed to exit if you have cfg.launch set
			and a save file can't be loaded for some reason.
		* Fixed : The main dialog always populated the warp list with
			the first file's maps even if it's unavailable.
		* Fixed : Cfg_ReadSave() Didn't populate the save list when a
			new IWAD is set. -- Thanks Belial

!-- Version 3.0a --!
	*-- Dec 2nd 2005 --*
		* Fixed : Dlg_Launch() Didn't put spaces around the EXE or IWAD
			names, this would make the ZDoom IWAD dialog pop up.
		* Fixed : Cfg_GetSel() Always checked for port[i] instead of
			item[i] resulting in IWADs after the last port to always
			crash ZDL -- Thanks Belial
