ZDL-3
=====

This project is **dead** now. (well, the master branch is anyway >.> )

You can still use it of course, but as I no longer use Windows, I can't continue
to develop it. I have also added the common forks people have created as
branches of this repository.

* **master:** The original source as released by me back in 2006.
* **risen:** [Risen's ZDL-3.1](http://twicerisen.ath.cx/zdl/) fixes/changes.
* **wildgoose:** [WildGoose's ZDL-3.1a](http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~chiry/doom/zdl/) fixes/changes.

Thanks a lot to all the users out there for keeping ZDL alive all this time! :)
